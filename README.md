Amalgo is a command-line tool that creates consolidated snapshots of source code for analysis, documentation, and sharing with [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). It helps developers gather and organize their codebase into a single, well-structured document.

## Features

- üìÅ **Directory Tree Generation**: Creates a visual representation of your project structure
- üìù **Code Content Dumping**: Consolidates all source files into a single document
- üîç **Language-Specific Outlines**: Generates structural outlines for supported programming languages
- üé® **Syntax Support**: Currently supports Go, with extensibility for other languages
- ‚ö° **Flexible Filtering**: Include/exclude files using glob patterns
- üö´ **Binary File Handling**: Option to skip or include binary files
- üéØ **Selective Processing**: Ignore specific directories and hidden files

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Project Onboarding & Understanding
Get up to speed quickly with new codebases:
- Generate comprehensive snapshots for LLM-powered project exploration
- Understand architectural patterns and design decisions
- Identify key components and their relationships
- Perfect for new team members and project handovers

### 2. Project Documentation Generation
Quickly create and maintain project documentation:
- Generate READMEs that accurately reflect the current codebase
- Create architecture diagrams and explanations backed by actual code
- Build API documentation with real usage examples
- Keep documentation synchronized with code as projects evolve

### 3. Smart Code Reviews & Pull Requests
Generate context-rich snapshots of changes that help LLMs provide deeper insights:
- Create comprehensive PR descriptions that understand implementation context
- Generate targeted review checklists based on affected code patterns
- Identify potential impacts on dependent modules and services
- Go beyond simple diffs to understand architectural implications

### 2. Security Audit Assistant
Leverage full codebase context for better security analysis:
- Generate complete snapshots including configs, dependencies, and source code
- Enable security-focused LLMs to identify complex vulnerability patterns
- Catch security issues that emerge from component interactions
- Perfect for pre-release audits and open-source project maintenance

### 4. Architectural Decision Analysis
Make informed architectural decisions with full context:
- Compare different approaches using comprehensive snapshots
- Generate impact analysis reports for proposed changes
- Document architectural decisions with complete implementation context
- Track the evolution of architectural choices over time

### 5. Enhanced Bug Resolution
Provide LLMs with all the context needed for better bug fixing:
- Include related tests, configs, and error contexts in snapshots
- Enable root cause analysis with full system context
- Get fix suggestions that consider potential side effects
- Generate targeted test cases for better coverage

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/Broderick-Westrope/amalgo@latest
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
amalgo [flags] [directories...]
```

Example commands:

```bash
# Analyze current directory
amalgo

# Analyze specific directories
amalgo ./src ./lib

# Output to a specific file
amalgo -o output.txt ./src

# Print output to stdout
amalgo --stdout ./src

# Include only specific file types
amalgo -f "*.go" -f "*.js" ./src

# Ignore certain directories
amalgo -i node_modules -i .git ./src

# Generate only the outline
amalgo --no-tree --no-dump --outline ./src

# Include hidden files
amalgo --include-hidden ./src
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-o, --output` | Output file path | `amalgo.txt` |
| `--stdout` | Write output to stdout instead of file | `false` |
| `-i, --ignore-dirs` | Directories to ignore | `[]` |
| `-f, --filter` | File patterns to include (e.g., '*.go', '*.{js,ts}') | `["*"]` |
| `--include-hidden` | Include hidden files and directories | `false` |
| `--no-tree` | Skip directory tree generation | `false` |
| `--no-dump` | Skip file content dumping | `false` |
| `--outline` | Generate language-specific outlines | `false` |
| `--no-color` | Don't use color in the terminal output | `false` |
| `--include-binary` | Include binary files | `false` |
| `-v, --version` | Print version information and quit | |

## Output Format

The generated output file includes:

1. **Header**: Timestamp and generation information
2. **Directory Tree**: Visual representation of the project structure (unless `--no-tree` is specified)
3. **Language-Specific Outlines**: Structural analysis of supported source files (if `--outline` is specified)
4. **File Contents**: Complete source code of all included files (unless `--no-dump` is specified)

Example output:
