# Ideas

This is intended to be a haphazard list of ideas for the project. If anything resonates with you feel free to start a discussion since an idea being here does not imply any plan to implement it.

1. Language Support Expansion
- Add parsers for other popular languages like Python, TypeScript, and Rust
- Create a modular parser interface that makes it easy for contributors to add new language support
- Include special handling for configuration files (JSON, YAML, TOML) and documentation files (Markdown, RST)

2. Enhanced Analysis Features
- Generate dependency graphs between files and components
- Add cyclomatic complexity analysis for supported languages
- Include basic static analysis to identify potential code smells or anti-patterns
- Add support for analyzing imported packages and external dependencies
- Generate metrics like lines of code, comment ratio, and function complexity

3. Output Format Improvements
- Add support for different output formats (JSON, YAML, HTML)
- Create a templating system for customizable output formats
- Generate interactive HTML reports with collapsible sections and syntax highlighting
- Add options for generating UML diagrams from code structure
- Include a mode for generating documentation in standard formats (e.g., OpenAPI for REST APIs)

4. Smart Filtering Capabilities
- Add semantic-based filtering (e.g., "only public functions" or "only types that implement X interface")
- Support regex patterns in addition to glob patterns
- Add the ability to focus on specific code aspects (e.g., only interfaces, only exported symbols)
- Include/exclude based on code complexity or other metrics

5. Integration Features
- Create GitHub Action for automated documentation generation
- Add integration with popular documentation platforms (ReadTheDocs, Docusaurus)
- Support for CI/CD pipelines with configurable outputs
- Integrate with code review tools to provide structural insights
- Add webhook support for automated processing

6. Performance Optimizations
- Implement parallel processing for file analysis
- Add incremental processing mode that only analyzes changed files
- Include caching mechanism for parsed results
- Optimize memory usage for large codebases
- Add streaming output options for very large projects

7. Developer Experience
- Add a config file option for persistent settings
- Create an interactive mode with TUI interface
- Add progress bars and better status reporting
- Implement a debug mode with detailed logging
- Add dry-run capability to preview output

8. Code Quality & Testing
- Add more comprehensive unit tests
- Implement integration tests with various real-world codebases
- Add benchmarking tests for performance monitoring
- Implement fuzzing tests for the parser
- Add end-to-end tests for common use cases

9. LLM-Specific Enhancements
- Add special formatting modes optimized for different LLM models
- Include token counting and automatic chunking for large codebases
- Add support for generating focused context windows
- Implement smart summarization of large files
- Add ability to generate targeted prompts for specific analysis tasks

10. Error Handling & Reporting
- Improve error messages with suggested fixes
- Add validation for complex configurations
- Implement graceful degradation when parsing fails
- Add warning system for potential issues
- Include detailed error context in output

11. Security Features
- Add support for detecting and handling sensitive information
- Implement exclude patterns for security-sensitive files
- Add options for obfuscating specific patterns (e.g., API keys)
- Include basic security scanning capabilities
- Add support for scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities
